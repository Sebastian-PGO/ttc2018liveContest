# Differential Dataflow implementation

This implementation is based on [Frank McSherry's work](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/ttc2018liveContest).

## User's Guide

Assuming that you use Ubuntu, you need the following prerequisites:

1. Install Rust as listed on https://rustup.rs/:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Install GCC:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```

Adjust the `config/config.json` file accordingly (add `differential` and/or `differential-08`) and run the program with:

```bash
scripts/run.py
```
